This document hold general information about the parts of the project

Threads
	Each thread waits for a barrier that is used by all threads to startup 
	before any operations is performed 

Communication 
	Receiver holds TCP connections to each replica 

	When data is propagated, a new TCP connection is performed 
	to the given replica. Receiver checks if there is any connection 
	that already exists. If not, store the connection. If a connection 
	exists, drop the connection.
